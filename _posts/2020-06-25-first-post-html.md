Hi. I'm panmari, a software engineer based in Europe. This is my first time writing a blog, so I'm not really sure where this is going.
I'm always excited about trying out new things, so don't expect the blog to keep revolving around the same topics.

Currently I'm into [flutter](https://flutter.dev), a framework for writing apps in a platform agnostic way. I'll have soon a longer blog post ready describing my struggles with writing and publishing my first flutter app.

Stay tuned!
